# The Effect of Different Obstructions on Accuracy of Facial Recognition

Using OpenCV Library, Caffee Model DNN, following tutorials online. We built this modified version of a facial recognition program. 
We then tested the accuracy of it using facial obstructions, like masks, hats, and glasses.

To use, run Terminal and put in python, path to file, path to prototext and path to the model.
Model/Prototext used within repo
